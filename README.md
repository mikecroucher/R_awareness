# R Awareness for IT Staff

This is designed to be a self-directed study session where you work through the material at your own pace.
It is designed to give IT Support staff an idea of what R can do along with an outline of the eco-system of tools that exist alongside it.

* It was delivered to a group of IT support staff and Research Software Engineers at University of Manchester on Friday 20th May 2016

## Presentation

The introductory presentation that goes with this material can be found at [http://mikecroucher.github.io/R_awareness/#/ ](http://mikecroucher.github.io/R_awareness/#/)

## What is R?

R is a free, open-source programming language that has very strong support for statistics. It was originally developed as an open source implementation of the [S Programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)).
It is used extensively in research and industry for areas such as data analysis, statistics, machine learning, bioinformatics, simulation, linguistics and much more.

With over [8000 freely available add-on packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/) that provide extensive additional functionality, R will probably have something that can help your research.

Don't just take my word for it though -- here's what others have to say

* [Why use R? Five reasons](http://www.econometricsbysimulation.com/2014/03/why-use-r-five-reasons.html) - From the 'Econometrics By Simulation' blog
* [The Popularity of Data Analysis Software](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/) - Compares R with SPSS, SAS, MATLAB etc
