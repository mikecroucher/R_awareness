Notes for this section

  Note some things:
   - When a user has their own machine, they can and do install as many R versions as they like. This is what they are used to.
     It takes a few seconds! It's a trivial concern.

  - They won't always want the newest version!
  Sometimes, they'll want a very specific version because they'll have a program that works on, say 2.12 (From 2010) but doesn't work on modern R.
  They may want to fix it but they need a version of R that it runs on in order to start this.

  R has been around since 2000 - over 16 years! There's a lot of code out there.

Packages
There're more repos than just the CRAN. The most popular one you might need to worry about is bioconductor.
