Open the file matmul.r in RStudio by clicking on it in the **Files** pane
Run it by clicking on **source** in the **matmul.r** window

Note which version of R is being used and note the time.
On my laptop, the matrix multiply took 1.5 seconds with Microsost r open 3.2.4

The open source version of R 3.2.4 took 78.62 seconds

The code kingsdream.r took 4.2 seconds in both versions of R
